# Parent Assist app

_A parenting resource that includes child development guide and digital child care tracking._

### Description

It would be a useful app for parents, especially moms who want to achieve mom-career time balance. The application would
be a well-structured and well-organized tool for child care and development, that will help parents understand their
child’s changing growth and development milestones.

### Main features

* **Child's development module** will help parents wisely spend money on child development by providing a guide with
  activities
  and toys for every growth stage, based on children's capabilities and the skills parents want to develop.
* **Child's health history module** will make medical visits and procedures easier by providing all necessary
  information to doctors with a
  quick share.

### Purpose

I believe that those parents who are highly concerned about their child’s overall well-being spend a lot of money and
time to achieve that. That is why this mobile app could be a profitable and successful startup.
